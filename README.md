After a long day of programming and analysis at work and school, I like to unwind by doing programming and analysis for volunteer organizations or simply for my own edification. 

Full-stack developer with experience in machine learning, data analytics, and database management. I've lost count of the number of languages I've programmed in, and I fully intend to lose count further as I learn more of them.
