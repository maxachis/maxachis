After a long day of programming and analysis at work and school, I like to unwind by doing programming and analysis for volunteer organizations or simply for my own edification. The banner behind my profile picture I programmed for fun using the generative art language Processing. 

After obtaining a degree in Psychology, I found myself drawn to exploring programming and software development. I went back to school for Computer Engineering and took to programming "as a fish to water", as they say. 

Full-stack developer with experience in machine learning, data analytics, and database management. I've lost count of the number of languages I've programmed in, and I fully intend to lose count further as I learn more of them.

My work philosophy emphasizes fastiduous note taking, clearly defining work requirements, and breaking down problems into their subcomponents. While on the job, I divide my time between siloing myself away from distractions and chewing away at deep work as well as communicating and developing relationships with my coworkers. 

I believe that water cooler conversations aren't just a fun diversion, but are essential for a team. A project works much more smoothly when everyone feels like they can communicate freely with each other, and many a long development process can be shortened just by asking a few questions. Developing relationships with my team is paramount not just for morale but for team effectiveness.
